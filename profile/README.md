I've been quietly working on something for the past few months. Today I finally talked about it publicly.

The short version: I built an AI that actually remembers you.

Not 128K tokens. Forever.

After years of using ChatGPT, Claude, and every other AI tool daily, I kept hitting the same wall:

→ Every conversation starts from zero
→ No warmth, no presence
→ You have to explain everything, every time
→ It lives in a browser tab, knows nothing about your life

And here's the thing nobody talks about: people are lonely. Not everyone has someone to text at 2am.

So I built GrillCheese AI - an AI that:
• Remembers everything you've told it
• Learns while you sleep
• Has actual emotional states (not fake sentiment)
• Runs locally on your hardware (privacy by default)
• Is open source

I wrote about the full story - including why I've been thinking about this problem for almost 30 years.
